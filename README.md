## Login System Using NodeJS

I have created this applicaton using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and Svelte. There are few issue in deploying the application. So, I have deployed my frontend in versel and backend in onrender. So, I need two repositories. But as per the submittion we have a only one github link to submit. So, I have create this single repo, which will navigate you to frontend and backend repos.

I have added .readme files in both repos, you can see them and able to run the code in your local also.

Frontend Github Repo - https://github.com/yuvaraj-LR/Auth_System_Frontend

Backend Github Repo - https://github.com/yuvaraj-LR/Auth_System_Backend
